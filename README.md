# Simple Elgato Keylight Air TUI

This is a super simple TUI to control brightness and temperature of my Elgato Keylight Air.
There are already a couple of different options to do this and I mainly created this as
an excuse to play around a bit with Rust :)

I.e. this is probably not what you want.

### Design requirements

 * Needs to take ip address of light since I have a some network "challenges" and the light is behind a NAT
 * Must work on both Mac OS X (untested) and Linux since I'm forced to use Mac at work.
